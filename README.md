### Why solar system❓❓
The solar system was created by me with the idea of working a bit on canvas and I'm interested in the **universe** so I thought a small project about planets would be a good practice for me 🤓 

### Interesting facts 💭
1. Each of these planets, apart from the sun, has its own acceleration.
2. Starry background looks very real and these are just small circles that are painted in a random color and of the same size.
3. I used sine and cosine to rotate the planets around the sun and itself.
4. Some of these planets also have their own moon.
5. The image of the solar system can be scaled.
